This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to create a hand gesture-controlled media player. It captures hand landmarks from a webcam and translates specific finger counts into media control actions:

1 Finger: Skip to the next track 2 Fingers: Go to the previous track 3 Fingers: Increase volume 4 Fingers: Decrease volume 5 Fingers: Play/Pause

Requirements: Python 3.x OpenCV MediaPipe PyAutoGUI
